**Summary:**

I am very interesting front-end development. **My main goal** is to get knowledge in this area. I understand that it is difficult and long process, but I have a potential and I am ready to learn and develop in this direction.  In the future I  want to have the opportunity to work in IT-company and  to become a high-level developer.

**Skills:**

* HTML
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code

**Code examples:**

```javascript
let calculator = {
  sum() {
    return (this.a + this.b);
  },
  mul() {
    return (this.a * this.b);
  },
  read() {
    this.a = + prompt("a?", 0);
    this.b  = + prompt("b?", 0);
  }
};
```
